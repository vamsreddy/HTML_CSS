    <h1>Cougar</h1>

        <p>The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat native to the Americas. Its range spans from the
                Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial
                mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat
                types. This wide range has brought it many common names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount and panther
                (for the Florida sub-population). It is the second-largest cat in the New World, after the jaguar (Panthera
                onca). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and
                crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to
                smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.</p>

        <p>The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates,
                particularly deer, but it also hunts smaller prey such as rodents. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and
                rocky areas for stalking, but also lives in open areas. Cougars are territorial and live at low population
                densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not
                always the apex predator in its range, yielding prey it has killed to American black bears, grizzly bears and
                packs of wolves. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but increased in
                North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.</p>

        <h2>Naming and etymology</h2>

                <p>The word cougar is borrowed from the Portuguese çuçuarana, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi
                        language. A current form in Brazil is suçuarana.[3] In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it cuguacu ara.
                        Marcgrave's rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by John
                        Ray in 1693.[4] In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar, which was later
                        modified to "cougar" in English.[5][6]</p>

        <h2>Behavior and ecology</h2>

            <h3>Hunting and diet</h3>

                    <p>The cougar is a generalist, hypercarnivore. They prefer large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk,
                            moose, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. They will opportunistically take smaller prey such as rodents,
                            lagomorphs, smaller carnivores, birds and even domestic animals including pets.[48] The mean weight of cougar
                            vertebrate prey increases with its body weight and is lower in areas closer to the equator. A survey of North
                            America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed
                            variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos.[32]</p>

        <h2>Interactions with other predators</h2>

                <p>Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or
                        scavengers occur. Of the large predators in Yellowstone National Park – the grizzly bear, the black bear, the
                        gray wolf, and the cougar – the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (but not always) able to drive a
                        gray wolf pack, an American black bear, and a cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and
                        American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of
                        carcasses. Bears gained up to 113% and cougars lost up to 26% of their respective daily energy requirements from
                        these encounters.[55] In Colorado and California, American black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills,
                        respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to American black bears when it comes to kills and when bears
                        are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several
                        subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal
                        refuges to avoid their competitors.[56][57]</p>

        <h2>Relationships with humans</h2>

            <h3 id="attacks">Attacks on humans</h3>

                <h4>In North America</h4>

                <p>Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks
                        on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize
                        humans as prey.[85] In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the
                        animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61
                        feet) except in 6% of cases; 14/16 of those were females with cubs.[86] Attacks on people, livestock, and pets
                        may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent
                        during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.[87]</p>

                        American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of
                        carcasses. Bears gained up to 113% and cougars lost up to 26% of their respective daily energy requirements from
                        these encounters.[55] In Colorado and California, American black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills,
                        respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to American black bears when it comes to kills and when bears
                        are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several
                        subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal
                        refuges to avoid their competitors.[56][57]</p>

            <h3>Attacks on humans</h3>

                <h4>In North America</h4>

                <p>Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks
                        on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize
                        humans as prey.[85] In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the
                        animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61
                        feet) except in 6% of cases; 14/16 of those were females with cubs.[86] Attacks on people, livestock, and pets
                        may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent
                        during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.[87]</p>

                        <h1>Cougar</h1>

        <p>The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat native to the Americas. Its range spans from the
                Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial
                mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat
                types. This wide range has brought it many common names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount and panther
                (for the Florida sub-population). It is the second-largest cat in the New World, after the jaguar (Panthera
                onca). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and
                crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to
                smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.</p>

        <p>The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates,
                particularly deer, but it also hunts smaller prey such as rodents. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and
                rocky areas for stalking, but also lives in open areas. Cougars are territorial and live at low population
                densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not
                always the apex predator in its range, yielding prey it has killed to American black bears, grizzly bears and
                packs of wolves. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but increased in
                North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.</p>

        <h2>Naming and etymology</h2>

                <p>The word cougar is borrowed from the Portuguese çuçuarana, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi
                        language. A current form in Brazil is suçuarana.[3] In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it cuguacu ara.
                        Marcgrave's rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by John
                        Ray in 1693.[4] In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar, which was later
                        modified to "cougar" in English.[5][6]</p>

        <h2>Behavior and ecology</h2>

            <h3>Hunting and diet</h3>

                    <p>The cougar is a generalist, hypercarnivore. They prefer large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk,
                            moose, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. They will opportunistically take smaller prey such as rodents,
                            lagomorphs, smaller carnivores, birds and even domestic animals including pets.[48] The mean weight of cougar
                            vertebrate prey increases with its body weight and is lower in areas closer to the equator. A survey of North
                            America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed
                            variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos.[32]</p>

        <h2>Interactions with other predators</h2>

                <p>Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or
                        scavengers occur. Of the large predators in Yellowstone National Park – the grizzly bear, the black bear, the
                        gray wolf, and the cougar – the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (but not always) able to drive a
                        gray wolf pack, an American black bear, and a cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and
                        American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of
                        carcasses. Bears gained up to 113% and cougars lost up to 26% of their respective daily energy requirements from
                        these encounters.[55] In Colorado and California, American black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills,
                        respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to American black bears when it comes to kills and when bears
                        are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several
                        subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal
                        refuges to avoid their competitors.[56][57]</p>
